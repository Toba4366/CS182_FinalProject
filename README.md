# CS 182 Final Project: In-Context Learning of Moore Machines

**🚧 GITHUB COPILOT SCAFFOLDING - TO BE EDITED AND CHANGED LATER 🚧**

This repository contains the scaffolding for our CS 182 final project on in-context learning of finite state machines using transformer models. This initial framework was generated with GitHub Copilot to provide a solid foundation for team collaboration.

## 🎯 Project Overview

We study how transformer models can learn to simulate Moore machines through in-context learning, focusing on:

- **Constrained FSM Parameters**: 5 states, 5-8 actions, 4-8 transitions with self-loops
- **Small Transformer Models**: Optimized for 2-3 layer experiments
- **AdamW Optimizer**: Single optimizer focus to reduce experimental scope
- **Frozen Layer Experiments**: Test whether only the final linear layer can solve ICL

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Test the setup:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_setup.py
   ```

3. **Run experiments:**
   ```bash
   # 2-layer transformer (default)
   python experiments/run_experiment.py --config configs/base_config.yaml
   
   # 3-layer comparison
   python experiments/run_experiment.py --config configs/3layer_config.yaml
   
   # Frozen layer experiment (only final layer trains)
   python experiments/run_experiment.py --config configs/frozen_layers_config.yaml
   ```

## 🧪 Experimental Configurations

### Base Configuration (`configs/base_config.yaml`)
- 2-layer transformer with 4 attention heads
- 128 model dimension, optimized for efficiency
- Standard training with all parameters trainable

### 3-Layer Configuration (`configs/3layer_config.yaml`) 
- 3-layer transformer for comparison
- Same hyperparameters for fair comparison

### Frozen Layer Configuration (`configs/frozen_layers_config.yaml`)
- **Tests core hypothesis**: Can only the final linear layer solve ICL?
- Freezes all transformer layers and embeddings
- Only the `lm_head` (final linear layer) remains trainable

## 🔬 Key Features

## 📊 Planned Experiments

1. **Baseline Performance**: 2-layer vs 3-layer transformers
2. **Frozen Layer Analysis**: Test if only final layer can solve ICL
3. **Scaling Studies**: Model size vs performance trade-offs
4. **Complexity Analysis**: FSM complexity vs learning difficulty
5. **Attention Visualization**: What patterns do transformers learn?
